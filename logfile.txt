    Added in validation to each of the categories of the catalog. So that when a seller goes to submit a catalog submission it stops them if it detects a blank category or an invalidly filled out category.

    Added in the Product Maintenance Application. Added in a database and then made the display of the database onto the seller's index page look better. Also added items that are for sale into our database. The maintenance application also features a way for sellers to edit already added items in their catalogs.
